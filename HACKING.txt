This version of the census app has been developed explicitly to reduce the
number of dependencies on external installations of software that developers
are unlikely to have installed. Therefore, a shell script is provided to
automate much of the process of fetching and building dependencies. A premium
is placed on ease of installation and speed in getting up and running. If you
make changes which will require new software, please ensure that the
installation process is added to get_deps.sh and ensure that every attempt is
made to allow ensure portability on unix-like systems.

To add new test types:
----------------------

	* add the installation of any resources the test type will require to
	  get_deps.sh
	* add the description and the HTML file to kick the test off from in
	  src/c2/tests.json
	* add a longer discussion about the test (if any) to a file in 
	  src/c2/descriptions/ and ensure that it's correctly referenced by the
	  "longDesc" entry in tsets.json
	* ensure that any build steps are added to make_census.sh

Notes on dependencies:
----------------------

	* the Flex SDK is currently using Flex 3. Since there's very little client
	  code actually required, we may not download the whole thing at some point
	  in the future.
	* in src/, there's a directory called "dojo_patches" which contains a pre-1.3
	  version of various dojox packages. These versions are used along-side the
	  stock Dojo 1.2.2 release in order to get some features that were added
	  post Dojo 1.2.2. When Dojo 1.3 is released, this directory will likely go
	  away. If you need updated versions of dojox packages, add them here and
	  ensure that they are coped in via the build sections of get_deps.sh.
	* we assume that BlazeDS or LCDS will be running in a separate Java VM due
	  to the configuration hassle of getting it up-and-running. Please do not
	  attempt to add them to run in-process if you are extending the tests to
	  depend on them. Anything that *really* requires J2EE is over-wrought and
	  badly designed...particularly if it's just shoveling data.

Joining the project:
--------------------

	If you're extending Census 2, please post patches in the bug tracking
	feature of the Google Code site for the project:

		http://code.google.com/p/census2

	If you'd like commit priveledges to add tests directly, please email the
	project owner (Alex Russell, alex@dojotoolkit.org) and note your acceptance
	of the license terms (LGPL v2) and your agreement with to contribute your
	new tests under those terms. No formal code style guidelines are in place,
	but in general tests should be written in the style suggested by the
	official Dojo JavaScript Style Guide.

	Thanks in advance for your help in improving the accuracy, fairness, and
	performance of this test suite.

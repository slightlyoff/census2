This version of the census app has been developed explicitly to reduce the
number of dependencies on external installations of software that real people
are unlikely to have installed. Therefore, a shell script is provided to
automate much of the process of fetching and building dependencies. A premium
is placed on ease of installation and speed in getting up and running. If you
make changes which will require new software, please ensure that the
installation process is added to get_deps.sh

To add new test types:

	* add the installation of any resources the test type will require to
	  get_deps.sh
	* add the description and the HTML file to kick the test off from in
	  src/c2/tests.json
	* ensure that any build steps are added to make_census.sh

Notes on dependencies:

	* the Flex SDK is currently using Flex 3. Since there's very little client
	  code actually required, we may not download the whole thing at some point
	  in the future.
	* in src/, there's a directory called "charting" which contains a pre-1.2.2
	  version of Dojo Charting. This is used along-side the stock Dojo 1.2.1
	  release in order to get some features (namely the ability to set a
	  minimum bar thickness) that were added post Dojo 1.2.1. When 1.2.2 or 1.3
	  are released, this directory will go away.
	* we assume that BlazeDS will be running in a separate Java VM due to the
	  configuration hassle of getting it up-and-running. Anything that *really*
	  requires J2EE is over-wrought and badly designed...particularly if it's
	  just shoveling data.

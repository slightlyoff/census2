Method:
<p>
	Make an XMLHttpRequest to the server for XML encoded rows of data. XML is
	parsed with the browser's built-in parser (as provided by the
	XMLHttpRequest object). HTML is generated by script iteration over the XML
	DOM and the results are injected into the document using
	<code>innerHTML</code>. As in previous tests, the HTML table output is
	optimized for rendering speed.
</p>
Results:
<p>
	XML is just plain slow. From it's relatively large footprint on the wire
	(30% greater than un-optimized JSON) to the need to do complicated parsing
	to the performance of script iteration over the XML DOM, XML + JS is likely
	the worst performer of the set of possible combinations as it joins the
	worst bits of the JSON test combined with HTML's size disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
	Generate server-side XML and process it client-side with script at your own
	risk.

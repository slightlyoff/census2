Method:
<p>
	Make an XMLHttpRequest to the server for JSON data which is decoded with
	<code>eval()</code> and then iterated over to create the markp for the
	table. The markup is then injected into the document using innerHTML.
	Tables have a style sheet applied which uses a fixed width and specifies
	<code>table-layout: fixed;</code> to avoid reflow calculations.
</p>
Results:
<p>
	This method is relatively parsimonious with network resources due to the
	reduced amount of encoding cruft inherent in JSON versus HTML or XML. Never
	the less, JSON data must be parsed before display and iterated on to build
	the resulting UI. Since this test fetches the entire set of rendered rows
	and uses string concatenation to create the HTML to create the table, this
	test stresses the browser's JavaScript engine performance vs. fetching
	pre-rendered rows.

Method:
<p>
	Create a Dojo Grid component and back it with a data that loads all of the
	rows via a single XMLHttpRequest for JSON-encoded data. Returned JSON data
	is processed to encapsulate it as "items" for consumption by the data APIs
	and then rendered to a Dojo Grid. The rendered grid structure is declared
	in markup so as not to give Dojo advantage that other tests don't enjoy.
</p>
Results:
<p>
	Slow...but not nearly as bad as XML. For large data sets, the overhead of
	fetching the entire set of rows is partially offset by the Grid's smarts
	not rendering rows that aren't immediately in view. Users, however, do pay
	a price both to load Dojo and for the inherently more feature-rich Dojo
	Grid. HTML tables don't provide sorting, filtering, locked headers, and
	many of the other features of the Dojo Grid, so it's not entirely
	apples-to-apples.
</p>
<p>
	If you need the features of a sophisticated Grid component, this might be a
	good way to get started, but as your data sets grow you should swap out the
	relatively slow <code>dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore</code> for the efficient
	<code>dojox.data.QueryReadStore</code>. If you have more limited needs of a
	grid, consider server-generated HTML plus <code>dojo.query()</code> for
	adding behaviors like sorting.

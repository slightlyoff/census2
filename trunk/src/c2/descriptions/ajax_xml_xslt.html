Method:
<p>
	Make an XMLHttpRequest to the server for XML encoded rows of data and then
	transform it by loading another XML document (an XSLT style sheet) for the
	built-in transformation engine to use. The overhead of an extra request is
	non-trivial for small data sets where the extra time may dwarf the
	transformation time itself.
</p>
<p>
	The transformation step itself diverges based on browser. On IE, it's
	possible to transform the document to a string which is then injected using
	innerHTML. On other browser the document is transformed into a DOM
	DocumentFragment which is then re-parented into the page since the
	XSLTProcessor class does not provide a simple "transform to string" API.
</p>
Results:
<p>
	XML is piggy, but by offloading the XSLT transform onto native code, we can
	perhaps do better than script-based transformations...right?
</p>
<p>
	Ish.
</p>
<p>
	For large numbers of rows, offloading the overhead of client transformation
	to native code can show dramatic overall speed gains. For instance, in
	Firefox 3.0 the total time to transform 5000 rows via XSLT is roughly half
	that of the same transform done in script. As scripting engines get faster,
	this delta may close, but XSLT is likely to remain highly competitive.
</p>
<p>
	For lower row counts, the inherent disadvantages of needing to load data in
	XML and pulling in a separate style sheet begin to show. For a test with
	only 500 rows, XSLT still maintains a slight edge over JSON, but the
	advantage is minimal and neither are quite as fast as raw HTML from the
	server.
</p>
<p>
	If you happen to have data on the server in XML format, might potentially
	need a lot of it,  and need to transform it to a static view you can't beat
	XSLT. On the downside, you'll need to learn XSLT. Oof.

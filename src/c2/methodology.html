		<h4>Setup:</h4>
		<p>
		This benchmark suite attempts to isolate client performance in
		rendering large amounts of business data. The server does little more
		than shovel easily computed data to clients in whatever format they
		request it, therefore no database is used and no artificial business
		logic is introduced which might skew the client-side rendering
		outcomes.
		</p>
		<h4>The Tests:</h4>
		<p>
		Each test is run (by default) 5 times. The outlier results (highest and
		lowest) are discarded and the remaining result times are averaged to
		genereate the displayed results. We do this to ensure that caches in
		the JVM, web server, browser JavaScript VM and HTTP caches, Flash
		engine, and servlet engine caches are warmed up such that the first
		test to run is not punished simply for being first. Tests are run
		multiple times to ensure that real-world performance (loading an
		application and then subsequently interacting with it for some long-ish
		period of time).
		</p>
		<p>
		Tests are run in iframes in an attempt to isolate them from the hosting
		browser environment. This is, clearly, not perfect. Variability in
		performance can be introduced by many browser-level issues, so we
		recommend that you run these tests with any in-browser debugging aids
		(particularly Firebug) disabled.
		</p>
		<h4>Getting Involved:</h4>
		<p>
		Census 2 is an Open Source project. Please see the "HACKING.txt" file
		to get started with modifying the code. You can submit bugs, feature
		requests, and patches <a href="http://code.google.com/p/census2/"
		target="_blank">at the Google Code project page</a> and get the latest
		sources.

Method:
<p>
	Make an XMLHttpRequest to the server for pre-rendered HTML tables of data.
	The results are injected into the document using innerHTML. Tables have a
	style sheet applied which uses a fixed width and specifies <code>table-layout:
	fixed;</code> to avoid reflow calculations.

Results:
<p>
	For small numbers of rows (&lt; 1000), this method renders fastest despite
	using a relatively verbose format on the wire, in part since the data
	doesn't need to be transformed in any way before rendering. At large
	numbers of rows (&gt; 3000), HTML tables suffer against their "smarter"
	competitors since they need to both transfer and render all the rows in the
	grid. Compared to Flex and Dojo grids, these HTML tables are incredibly
	inflexible and provide the fewest features but for small data sets are
	hands-down fastest.
